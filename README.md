# Collaborative-Sentiment-Extraction-and-Modeling-Framework
In today's social media-driven world, Twitter is a key platform for expressing opinions and sentiments. Analyzing these sentiments at scale is crucial for understanding public perceptions and trends. This project introduces the Collaborative Sentiment Extraction and Modeling Framework, designed to extract, analyze, and visualize sentiments from a corpus of tweets using the TextBlob library.

Features
Sentiment Classification: The framework categorizes sentiments into five distinct classes:
Positive
Semi-positive
Negative
Weakly negative
Neutral
Visualization: Sentiment results are presented through clear pie chart visualizations.
Process
Data Input: The framework processes a CSV file containing tweets, serving as the input source.
Data Preprocessing: Key tasks include data cleansing, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and text normalization to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
Sentiment Analysis: Leveraging TextBlobâ€™s lexicon-based approach, the sentiment of each tweet is determined and classified into one of the five categories, providing more depth than the traditional binary classification.
Key Benefits
Accuracy: Ensures reliable sentiment analysis by working on preprocessed data.
Scalability: Can handle large datasets for sentiment extraction.
Nuanced Insights: Moves beyond simple positive/negative labels to offer richer sentiment insights.
This framework offers a streamlined, efficient solution for analyzing Twitter sentiment, making it a valuable tool for tracking sentiment trends across large datasets.
